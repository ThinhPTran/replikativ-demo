# replikativ-demo

This is demonstration of how to build a `p2p` network with
[replikativ](https://github.com/replikativ/replikativ) and distribute
state changes with it. See
[replikativ-cljs-demo](https://github.com/replikativ/replikativ-cljs-demo)
for the corresponding ClojureScript project.

Walk through the examples of the `core.clj` namespace in the REPL to explore `replikativ`.
